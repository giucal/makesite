<h1>Ontology</h1>
<p>First draft: 2021-02-17</p>
<p><em>This essay summarizes my metaphysical wanderings since I’ve been studying Hume, Kant, and the idealists in high school. I hope you’ll enjoy reading about them as much as I enjoyed living through them.</em></p>
<p>The concept of substance is unnecessary for explaining the fact that we experience reality; form suffices.</p>
<p>Uncritically assuming this thesis for a moment, we can derive that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>All worlds, per se, have the same ontological dignity.</li>
<li><em>This</em> world, <em>reality,</em> is special only in the sense we are part of it.</li>
<li>The fact that we have an experience is a structural feature of this world. The fact that we can say that it exists is too a structural feature of this world.</li>
<li>The same can be said of <em>any</em> subject of <em>any</em> world: all the worlds are present to their subjects, if they have some; but these worlds are—to steal an effective metaphor—without windows.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, for the boring part.</p>
<h2>Premises</h2>
<h3>Existence</h3>
<p>When we say that something <em>exists,</em> we often mean that it’s part of <em>reality.</em> Often, not always; but insofar as metaphysics is concerned, existence as <em>being there</em> always implies a reality. The Moon exists because it’s there in the sky. Children will say that the Tooth Fairy exists because, after all, someone must be collecting their teeth in exchange for cents; to them, she is and acts in the world. Believers will say that God exists, by which they mean He’s <em>out there.</em></p>
<p>This is, I believe, the conventional interpretation of existence: the fact that something is not just in our mind, but is part of a broader reality, regardless of what <em>reality</em> actually is. It may not be the only interpretation, but I guess it entails much of the relevant usage. I say <em>regardless of what reality actually is</em> for, when we turn to establish what <em>reality</em> means, we find ourselves referring one way or another back to existence.</p>
<p>Is reality everything? It can’t be, since <em>everything</em> is too broad a term: it includes concepts, thoughts, works of imagination, mathematical systems, etc., things that we might not be willing to call real.</p>
<p>Is reality the sum of everything which… exists? That’s a good characterization of reality, despite being tautological. Had we chosen a definition of existence that didn’t refer to reality, we <em>might</em> have arrived at different conclusions. But a different definition of existence would still need to be consistent with common use; otherwise we’d be talking past each other, as it’s often the case with philosophy, especially metaphysics. Having found no good alternative, I’ll leave definitions as they are; but in doing so, I encourage you to ponder on the prominent or immaterial role they play in establishing the validity of the thesis.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two concepts of existence and reality is firm yet purely formal. Existence is the property of what belongs to reality, which in turn is the class of all that exists. But such relationship only tells us of the existence of things which we already know whether are part of reality; and vice versa, it only tells us whether something is part of reality which we already know whether exists. Given a thing <em>x</em>, we can say whether <em>x</em> exists only if we already know whether it is part of reality; and vice versa. Thus, existence and reality are <em>primitive</em> concepts—like points and segments in geometry—whose relative meaning—the meaning they carry between themselves—is conventional and can be explained, but whose absolute meaning—that they carry with respect to our experience—despite also conventional, can only be <em>shown</em> [Wittgenstein]. Indeed, we learn the meaning of primitive concepts by examples.</p>
<h3>Worlds</h3>
<!--
Old draft

Existence can only be given *inside* the world; outside of the world, it is meaningless. That of substance is a concept derived from the passive component of our experience: we fall sick, hurt ourselves, feel pain, die. All this implies that we are not in total control of our experience. Something must be responsible for the ineluctable, and that something we call reality.

Now, reality is so and so: how comes? Might it be different? Might it be nothing at all? This is an old question. I argue that, all things considered, the reason we think the question is worth asking in the first place is that we believe in "substantial essence": the fact that substance and form are joint and inseparable, and that the former makes things exist rather than not, while the latter makes them what they are, and not something else. But, if substance is a fictional concept, only form -- what things are in themselves -- is relevant in the metaphysical discourse.

Given this premise, we are forced to look at the same question in a new light.
It was substance that distinguished the existent from the non-existent; but if substance is a chimera, what prevents all things to exist all at once? or to not exist at all? or to this world not to exist the way it does? Since existence is metaphysically meaningless, the answer is: nothing. There is not an "ontological space" that forms occupy in order to exist. All that we can say is that, tautologically, everything is what it is. In particular, our world, being itself, contains us; and we, subjects, observe that this world exist. Hence, by convention, this world exists. On the other hand, we are in a world that, by virtue of its form, permits and implies our experience.

A curious consequence of this notion is all the worlds are *qualia* to their subjects; but these worlds are -- to steal an effective metaphor -- without windows.

We cannot tell precisely what, but we know at least what it is like to be a brain in a world: our everyday experience: perception and its qualities, feelings, conscience, memory, etc.
